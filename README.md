Developed real-time ASL finger spelling recognition system achieving 98% accuracy, using a custom dataset of ~7000 images across alphabets.
Applied OpenCV preprocessing (Gaussian blur, thresholding) and dual-layer CNN classifier (TensorFlow/Keras) with frame validation and Hunspell autocorrect for sentence formation.
Resolved symbol confusions (e.g., D/R/U) via sub-classifiers and dataset enhancements.
